scripts.modell
==============

| *modell.py* provides functions to calculate diode current for a given voltage. 
| Creates instances of *regions.py* classes to describe pn-diode.

Upon execution piecewise functions for pn-values are constructed using the above mentioned instances and those are saved using ``cache.save_to_file()``.

Must be executed at least once before *generate_graphs.py* can be executed.
